    <p>Hello :)</p>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;The goal of the app is to direct those who are either homeless 
        &emsp;or lack stable housing to a homeless shelter.
        &emsp;Once you enter the information required, you will be directed to three 
        &emsp;shelters we believe are the best fit for you.
        &emsp;From there a location will be provided for each of the three.
        &emsp;Thank you for using the app :)
    </p>
