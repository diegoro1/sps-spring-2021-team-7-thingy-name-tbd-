    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the app is to direct those who are either homeless 
        or lack stable housing to a homeless shelter.
        Once you enter the information required, you will be directed to three 
        shelters we believe are the best fit for you.
        From there a location will be provided for each of the three.
        Thank you for using the app :)
